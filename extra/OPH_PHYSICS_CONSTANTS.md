# OPH Physics Constants Map

This file is a working map of the main constants and fixed parameters of modern physics, and how far the current OPH corpus derives them.

I am treating "important constants" broadly enough to include:

- fundamental couplings and scales
- particle masses
- flavor and mixing parameters
- the main gravity and cosmology constants
- the main discrete Standard Model numbers

I am not expanding every algebraically redundant quantity. For example:

- I list `alpha`-type couplings instead of duplicating them as both `alpha_i` and `g_i`.
- I list fermion masses rather than every Yukawa separately when the latter are just `y_f = sqrt(2) m_f / v`.
- I stop at the fundamental-physics layer plus flagship hadron outputs.

Tracker note:

- issue links in the `Tracker` column point to the GitHub tracker at `FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography`

## OPH Fundamental Constants

These are OPH's own starting constants, so they are intentionally not listed as "not yet derived" rows in the tables below.

They are calibrated OPH implementation inputs, not theorem targets.

- `P = a_cell / l_P^2`
- `N_scr = log dim H_tot`

## Status Rule

- `fully derived`: fixed by the present OPH structural theorem package once the realized branch is chosen, with no extra continuous implementation input beyond that branch.
- `conditional`: derived once OPH is supplied with one or more declared implementation inputs, usually `P` and/or `N_scr`, and sometimes a specific calibration or continuation branch.
- `not yet derived`: the present corpus does not close the physical theorem lane. Compare-only adapters, same-family witnesses, and frozen simulation scaffolds do not count as closed derivations.

## Core Unit-Setting Constants

| Constant / parameter | Identified - summary | OPH constants required | How OPH derives it | Status | Tracker |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `c` | Universal causal speed. | structural Lorentz branch only | Once the Lorentzian branch is recovered, OPH gets one invariant causal speed for all patches. The translated SI number then matches exactly by unit convention rather than by a second physical fit. | fully derived | [#106](https://github.com/FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography/issues/106), [#159](https://github.com/FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography/issues/159) |
| `hbar` | Quantum of action. | no closed OPH normalization yet | OPH recovers quantum/Hilbert/Born structure, but the current corpus does not emit a standalone numerical `hbar` artifact. | not yet derived | [#156](https://github.com/FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography/issues/156) |
| `k_B` | Entropy-temperature conversion factor. | no closed OPH normalization yet | OPH recovers the horizon thermodynamic structure, but the current corpus does not emit a standalone numerical `k_B` artifact. | not yet derived | [#156](https://github.com/FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography/issues/156) |

| `Lambda` | Cosmological constant. Current benchmark `1.09e-52 m^-2`. | `G + N_scr` | OPH identifies `Lambda` as a global capacity parameter, not a local vacuum-energy output: `Lambda = 3*pi / (G N_scr)`. | conditional | — |

| `S_dS` | de Sitter horizon entropy. Current benchmark `3.30998e122` nats, or `4.77529e122` bits. | `N_scr` | In the static-patch reading this is the screen-capacity variable itself. Numerically it also matches `A_dS / (4 l_P^2)` once units are fixed. | conditional | — |
| `T_dS` | de Sitter temperature. Current benchmark `2.19678e-30 K`. | `G + N_scr` | Downstream from `H_dS` via `T_dS = hbar H / (2*pi k_B)`. | conditional | — |
| `rho_Lambda` | Dark-energy density. Current benchmark `5.84013e-27 kg m^-3`. | `G + N_scr` | Downstream algebraic quantity from `Lambda` and `G`. | conditional | — |
| `a_0^(OPH)` | MOND-like IR acceleration benchmark. Current benchmark `1.02919e-10 m s^-2`. | `G + N_scr + modular-anomaly branch` | If the deep-IR response is controlled by the de Sitter scale and the fixed anomaly prefactor, OPH gives `a_0 = (15 / (8*pi^2)) c^2 sqrt(Lambda / 3)`. | conditional | — |

## Bridge Program: `W/Z -> Edge Entropy -> G`

This is the unification statement worth pushing.

The clean claim is not:

- "`G` is already numerically derived from `P`"

because `P = a_cell / l_P^2`, and `l_P^2` already contains `G`.

The clean claim is:

- the same OPH edge-entropy law that calibrates the electroweak `W/Z` sector should also set Newton matching on the gravity side

### Current Electroweak Side

On the D10 branch, the forward transmutation certificate makes the electroweak chain explicit:

```text
P
-> alpha_U
-> (t_U, t_tr)
-> (alpha_2, alpha_Y, v)
-> (W, Z)
```

The explicit pixel-closure law on that surface is

```text
ellbar_SU2(t2_mz_run) + ellbar_SU3(t3_mz_run) = P / 4
```

So the `W/Z` calibration is already controlled by heat-kernel edge entropy data, not by an unrelated fitted sector.

### Current Gravity Side

On the gravity side, the compact paper gives the Newton matching formula

```text
G = a_cell / (4 * ellbar(t))
```

where `ellbar(t)` is the single-cell edge entropy density from the heat-kernel edge distribution.

### Intended Unification Statement

What OPH wants to show is:

1. the `ellbar` controlling the D10 pixel-closure law is the same OPH edge-entropy object that appears in Newton matching
2. the electroweak calibration therefore fixes the same edge microphysics that determines `G`
3. `W/Z` and `G` are then tied together by one common edge-entropy law rather than by two unrelated sectors

That would be the real Standard Model / GR bridge.

### What Is Still Missing

This is not yet a closed theorem-grade derivation. The remaining burden is to show, internally and non-circularly, that:

- the gravity-side `ellbar(t)` and the D10 heat-kernel entropy entering `P / 4` are literally the same OPH object
- the fixed-cutoff edge heat-kernel / Casimir theorem is lifted and identified strongly enough to carry both branches
- the D10 electroweak closure is promoted from a calibration surface to a theorem-grade predictive bridge

### Active Blockers

- [#158](https://github.com/FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography/issues/158) identify the shared edge entropy object across D10 and Newton matching
- [#31](https://github.com/FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography/issues/31) fix the transmutation parameter from `P` without circular calibration
- [#32](https://github.com/FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography/issues/32) derive RG matching and threshold structure from OPH
- [#33](https://github.com/FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography/issues/33) upgrade gauge/electroweak closure from consistency check to prediction
- [#159](https://github.com/FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography/issues/159) close the local unit bridge for familiar in-universe units
- [#22](https://github.com/FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography/issues/22) unify local Einstein recovery with the global cosmological-capacity branch
- [#106](https://github.com/FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography/issues/106) resolve the BW branch-selection and continuum algebra-type gap

Supporting upstream note:

- [#30](https://github.com/FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography/issues/30) is still open, but its pipeline status is already `completed` / `under audit` on the screen-microphysics paper. The remaining gap is no longer just "invent the heat-kernel law"; it is the compact-paper lift and cross-branch identification.

### Best Present-Day Wording

The strongest accurate wording today is:

- "OPH already has the skeleton of a `W/Z -> edge entropy -> G` bridge."
- "Electroweak calibration and Newton matching are controlled by the same edge-microphysics law, pending closure of the shared heat-kernel entropy object."

## Theorem Roadmap For Familiar In-Universe Units

The clean way to organize the familiar-unit problem is:

- dimensionless OPH outputs first
- then the local UV unit bridge from `a_cell`
- then the global de Sitter / capacity bridge from `N_scr`

Checked against the open `FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography` tracker on `2026-04-04`, the practical roadmap is:

| Target family | Current OPH output | What still has to be proved or calculated | Varies with | Tracker | Current conditional target surface |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `c` | Structural Lorentz output: one invariant causal speed. | Keep the BW / Lorentz branch honest; for SI display, close the local unit bridge `c = ell_cell / tau_cell`. | invariant itself: neither; SI display: `a_cell` only | [#106](https://github.com/FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography/issues/106), [#159](https://github.com/FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography/issues/159) | `c = 299792458 m/s`, with `ell_cell = 2.06409e-35 m` and `tau_cell = 6.88507e-44 s` |

### Execution Order

If the goal is to maximize how many familiar constants OPH can quote numerically without overclaiming, the practical order is:

1. keep the Lorentz / BW branch honest enough that `c` and the local geometric language sit on a declared branch: [#106](https://github.com/FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography/issues/106)
2. finish the shared edge-entropy bridge needed for non-circular `G`: [#158](https://github.com/FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography/issues/158), [#22](https://github.com/FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography/issues/22)
3. finish the forward electroweak promotion stack so `W/Z` and the couplings are theorem-facing outputs rather than calibrated checks: [#31](https://github.com/FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography/issues/31), [#32](https://github.com/FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography/issues/32), [#33](https://github.com/FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography/issues/33)
4. close the local familiar-unit bridge and settle the public role of `hbar` / `k_B`: [#159](https://github.com/FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography/issues/159), [#156](https://github.com/FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography/issues/156)
5. once `G` is clean, propagate the same bridge into `Lambda`, `H_dS`, and the other de Sitter descendants: [#47](https://github.com/FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography/issues/47), [#52](https://github.com/FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography/issues/52)
6. only after that expand the same familiar-unit surface deeper into Higgs/top, charged flavor, quarks, and hadrons: [#34](https://github.com/FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography/issues/34), [#152](https://github.com/FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography/issues/152), [#37](https://github.com/FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography/issues/37), [#157](https://github.com/FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography/issues/157)

### Conditional Familiar-Unit Targets If The Bridges Close

If the remaining theorem gaps close on the presently realized branch, the familiar-unit target surface to compare against is:

- local cell bridge: `a_cell = 4.2604724363543046e-70 m^2`, `ell_cell = 2.0640911889629063e-35 m`, `tau_cell = 6.885067098528897e-44 s`, `E_cell = 9.559993349864843e18 GeV`
- causal speed: `c = 299792458 m/s`
- electroweak bosons: `M_W = 80.37700001539531 GeV`, `M_Z = 91.18797807794321 GeV`
- Higgs / top: `M_H = 125.218922060 GeV`, `m_t = 172.388645595 GeV`
- dimensionless electroweak surface: `alpha_U = 0.04112498041477454`, `alpha_em(m_Z)^-1 = 128.30576920`, `sin^2 theta_W(m_Z) = 0.2307354235`
- Fermi constant: `G_F = 1.16120908925587e-5 GeV^-2`
- Newton bridge target: if `ellbar = P / 4`, then `G = 6.6743e-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2`
- cosmology benchmark surface: `Lambda = 1.09e-52 m^-2`, `H_dS = 1.80706e-18 s^-1 = 55.76 km s^-1 Mpc^-1`, `r_dS = 1.65900e26 m`, `rho_Lambda = 5.84013e-27 kg m^-3`

## Comparison To Official Reference Values

For the unit-setting constants, the comparison has to be separated into three categories:

- exact-by-definition SI matches
- conditional bridge matches
- not-yet-comparable quantities

### Exact-By-Definition SI Match

- `c`: the translated OPH familiar-unit value is `299792458 m/s`, which matches the official SI / NIST value exactly. This is not an independent particle-style postdiction; it is exact because the SI meter is defined from the speed of light once the invariant causal speed has been chosen as the unit bridge.

### Conditional Bridge Match

- `G`: if the shared-entropy bridge closes with `ellbar = P / 4`, then the OPH familiar-unit target is `6.6743e-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2`, matching the CODATA / NIST value `6.67430(15)e-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2` at the quoted digits. This is numerically strong, but it is not yet a theorem-grade independent prediction because the shared `ellbar` identification and the local familiar-unit bridge remain open.

### Not Yet Comparable As Standalone OPH Outputs

- `hbar`: official SI / NIST value exists, but OPH does not yet emit an independent standalone `hbar` artifact.
- `k_B`: official SI / NIST value exists, but OPH does not yet emit an independent standalone `k_B` artifact.

### Not Apples-To-Apples With A Present-Day Measurement

- `H_dS`: OPH’s `55.76 km s^-1 Mpc^-1` benchmark is the asymptotic de Sitter Hubble scale, not the observed present-day `H_0`, so it should not be compared directly to late-time observational `H_0` fits.

## Numerical Cosmology Outputs Available Right Now

Using the current benchmark `Lambda = 1.09e-52 m^-2`, OPH already lets us compute:

- `H_dS = c * sqrt(Lambda / 3) = 1.80706e-18 s^-1 = 55.76 km s^-1 Mpc^-1`
- `r_dS = sqrt(3 / Lambda) = 1.65900e26 m`
- `A_dS = 4*pi*r_dS^2 = 3.45863e53 m^2`
- `S_dS = A_dS / (4 l_P^2) = 3.30998e122` nats `= 4.77529e122` bits
- `T_dS = hbar H_dS / (2*pi k_B) = 2.19678e-30 K`
- `rho_Lambda = Lambda c^2 / (8*pi G) = 5.84013e-27 kg m^-3`
- `a_0^(OPH) = (15 / (8*pi^2)) c^2 sqrt(Lambda / 3) = 1.02919e-10 m s^-2`

## Fast Reading Summary

Today, the OPH constant story looks like this:

- fully derived: the discrete Standard Model structure (`G_phys`, `N_g`, `N_c`, exact hypercharges) and the exact structural zeros (`m_gamma = 0`, `m_gluon = 0`, `m_graviton = 0`)
- conditional on `P`: the D10/D11 quantitative electroweak-Higgs-top stack, the QCD `Lambda_MSbar` descendant, and the theorem-grade neutrino branch
- conditional on `N_scr`: `Lambda` and its de Sitter descendants
- not yet derived: `hbar`, `k_B`, the physical charged-lepton theorem lane, the physical quark/CKM theorem lane, physical Majorana phases, strong CP, and the hadron spectrum
