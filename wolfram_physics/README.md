# Wolfram Physics

This folder holds OPH material connected to the Wolfram observer and Ruliad program.

The basic idea: Senchal's observer theory says the right rule must admit observers whose reality is shaped by boundedness, persistence, and relevance. OPH adds observer overlap consistency and quotient repair. The paper here studies how those ingredients can cut down rule space.

The local paper in this folder is [Observer-Consistent Semantic Quotients for the Ruliad](papers/observer_consistent_semantic_quotients_for_the_ruliad.pdf).

The toy benchmark code for the paper is in [code/ruliad_toy_benchmark.py](code/ruliad_toy_benchmark.py), with the regression check in [code/test_ruliad_toy_benchmark.py](code/test_ruliad_toy_benchmark.py) and the computed output in [code/ruliad_toy_benchmark_results.json](code/ruliad_toy_benchmark_results.json).

The toy benchmark in the paper gives a concrete pruning result. After the confluence and holonomy filters, 92 of 154 raw rule families survive, so 59.7% survive and 40.3% are excluded. The observer quotient reduces the corpus to 8 semantic classes, with 2 classes on the defect-free target.

This folder contains the authored bridge paper, the toy benchmark code, and the figure assets used by the paper.
